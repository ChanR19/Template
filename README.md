Let me know if you need help figuring out the code or if you run into a bug. I'll be happy to help. Also let me know if you need help in any of your other events.
## How to setup and run/edit project:
1. Click on "Clone or download" (the green button on the upper right hand corner), then "Download ZIP"
2. Extract it to somewhere where you can find it.
3. Install a text editor, like Atom (https://atom.io) or Notepad++ (https://notepad-plus-plus.org/)
4. Open Atom and go to "File" > "Open folder." Then find the extracted file and click on "Select Folder." Open the drop down menus on the left side to view and edit the code.
5. To run the code, open the extracted file in your File Explorer and double click on the "index.html" file.
## Must know:
Whenever you add a new file, you must add this:
> <script language="javascript" type="text/javascript" src="NewFileName.js"></script>
to the index.html file.
